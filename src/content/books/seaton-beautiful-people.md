authorLastname: Seaton
author: Maureen Seaton and Aaron Smuth
cover: assets/beautiful.png
description: Beautiful People was written back and forth over the course of
  several months by poets Maureen Seaton and Aaron Smith. Bold and inventive, it
  moves from sonnets and sestinas to prose poems and so much more. While its
  center is a love for poetry and art and laughter, the poets also grapple with
  mortality, sadness, and what it means to be alive on a broken but beautiful
  planet. Through their literary friendship, they put a mirror to all our lovely
  faces.
