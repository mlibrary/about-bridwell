description: William Stevenson (1768-1857) was a pioneer itinerant Methodist
  preacher in the southwestern United States, who became the first Protestant of
  any denomination to preach within the bounds of what is now Texas. His
  Autobiography, a classic account of frontier and folk Methodism, was first
  published in serial form in the New Orleans Christian Advocate between March
  13 and April 24, 1858. A typescript copy was sent to Bridwell Library in 1936,
  at the request of SMU President C. C. Selecman. Bridwell Library published the
  complete Autobiography in 2015, and Bridwell Press is pleased to bring this
  work to a new audience in 2024.
