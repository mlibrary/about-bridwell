authorLastname: Rilke
author: Rainer Maria Rilke and Christopher Anderson
cover: assets/rilke.png
description: Rainer Maria Rilke’s fifteen-part poetic cycle Das Marien-Leben
  stands as his most eloquent meditation on Mary, the mother of Jesus, whose
  name he shares. Rilke composed these verses in 1912, and ten years later, Paul
  Hindemith chose to heighten their rhetoric in an expansive song cycle for
  soprano and piano, the music revised in 1948. The present edition offers a
  fresh translation of the texts by Christopher Anderson alongside the sensitive
  artwork of Nishiki Sugawara-Beda, who has fashioned her concept particularly
  around Hindemith’s music.
