Bridwell Press is the professional publishing arm of Bridwell Library. For seventy years, Bridwell Library has published titles associated with its collections, from exhibition catalogs and Methodist works to biographies and occasional papers. Bridwell Press balances the libraryâ€™s legacy with a more openly defined space for scholarly activity.

## Our Mission and Values

Our mission is to engage with a broad community of authors, who seek to publish creative, quality, and freely accessible works on a global scale. We believe there is room for new, adventurous, and diverse thinking in publishing, especially as it supports emerging scholars that may not have easy opportunities to publish. We value open source, interdisciplinary, and creatively unorthodox scholarship.
